# shuffle-deck

1. The shuffle button shuffles a deck of 52 cards (no jokers) to random order
2. The deal button would show the first card of the deck
3. The description box would show some interesting advice or fun little things to do
4. If you want to reset the game, simply hit reset and shuffle again!

Game Variations for 1 person:
1. Even though it's not really a 'game', if you deal enough cards and read the description box, you might find something interesting!
2. Shuffle the deck, play the first card, and the number of the card will be your lucky number for the day!

Game Variations for 2 people:
1. Decide who deals first, who deals second and see who got a higher card!
